# Smali-Ruby
A more ruby like way to work with Smali files in JRuby.

### Usage Notes
The examples show how it can be used. Nodes are suppose to be immutable. Using the [Smali] ANTLR classes directly has advantages.

### Does it work?
Yes.

### What can it do?
I have used it to make search tools, extract data, and change field visibility.

### Requirements
You must have the [Smali] jar file in your project.

### Todo
  - Include the Smali jar (if the license  allows)
  - Package as a gem
